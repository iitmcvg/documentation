# VNC

We've allowed for vnc access to containers when you need to show windows.

However, since this occupies GPU memory, we recommend this be done only if absolutely needed.

## Procedure

Run VNC using any VNC client, eg: Real VNC.

Log on to the IP: PORT, PORT which is mapped for your container, with the required password.
