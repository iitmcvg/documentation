# Documentation Engine: CVI IIT Madras [Beta]

_Tentative 15th September for initial release._

Our markdown based documentation engine. 

## Usage

We enlist a set of repositories in the config file. These are then periodically pulled and processed to leave residue markdowns, side bars and nav bars. We use a markdown to html generator to then render a site which is globally version controlled.

## Philosophy 

Completely integrated into your github workflow.

This means no more incomplete, irrelevant or obsolete docs. Plus your job as a dev ends at dumping relevant markdown files, whether automatically rendered for module API documentation or handcrafted overall docs.

The rest flows like magic.
