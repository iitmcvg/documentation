We implement an experimental setup with face detection and recognition. This has been used for our purposes with the following aims:

* Swapping multiple detectors and feature extractors for facenet.
* Multi GPU and distributed support
* Frozen graph support with quantisation.

Primarily, we use this in two use cases:

* High accuracy: SSD or FRCNN detectors with Inception-Resnet feature extractors.
* CPU optimised FPS: SSDlite mobilenet with mobilenet V2 extractors (this is covered in *getting started*).
